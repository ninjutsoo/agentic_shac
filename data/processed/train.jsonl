Regarding his substance use, he has previously informed us he has 'used everything' (PO/inhaled/injected) including opioids, benzodiazepines, methamphetamine. He has misused opioids since age 16 following his hernia surgery. He was previously on buprenorphine/naloxone for a period of up to 7 years from 2005-2012 or 13, at times selling it to purchase 'pain pills' (e.g. oxyycodone, opana), and reportedly quit using this ~ 2 years ago. He relapsed to heroin use in [DATE] or [DATE], inhaled and then injected, ~1 gram daily ('I smoked some heroin and noticed I could walk as well as a normal person'. Other than during his recent hospitalization when he was prescribed methadone for a period of 4 months (titrated to 70mg over the course of that time), he has taken methadone in the past, no longer than several days and not through a licensed treatment program. He has been in inpatient treatment on 2 occasions, ~ 2 years total w/o achieving sustained sobriety. He describes having used testosterone/steroids at least twice, last in 2012 to 'get off' opioids, per his report with good success. He uses methamphetamine 3-4/30 days, on days when he does not have access to heroin. He denies current benzodiazepine or alcohol use. He endorses daily tobacco and cannabinoid use.", "trigger_text": "cannabinoid use", "status_label": "current"}
